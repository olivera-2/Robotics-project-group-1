This project is an autonomous delivery robot designed to transport packages safely and efficiently using sensors, AI, and navigation algorithms. The robot can detect obstacles, follow a mapped route, and deliver goods to predefined locations.
To build the design
We made use of Proteus software and Arduino Software
Arduino as the micro controller 
L293D as the Motor driver
Ultrasonic sensor
MOTOR as DC Motor
Vsource as the power source
We connected default to arduino and labeled it D0-D13
We made use of ground, power and default and connected it to the motor driver
We made use of POT-HG as the potentiometer
How it works- It avoids obstacles using ultrasonic sensors.
Once it reaches the destination, it drops off the package and returns.
